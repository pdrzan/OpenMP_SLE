# Implementation of a System of Linear Equations resolver using OpenMP

This repository is divided into three folders:

1. sequencialSLE
    - Implementation of a sequential resolver for a System of Linear Equations
2. openMP_SLE
    - Implementation of a parallel resolver for a System of Linear Equations using OpenMP
3. gaussElimination
    - Implementation of a sequencal and parallel resolver for System of Linear Equations using OpenMP

The three folders have the resulting running times for different system sizes. The objective of this experiment is to compare the running times of the implementations.
