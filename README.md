# Implementation of a System of Linear Equations resolver using OpenMP

This repository is divided into two folders:

1. sequencialSLE
    - Implementation of a sequential resolver for a System of Linear Equations
2. openMP_SLE
    - Implementation of a dynamic resolver for a System of Linear Equations using OpenMP

The two folders have the resulting running times for different system sizes. The objective of this experiment is to compare the running times of the two implementations.
